# WF radio

## 🚧 Warning: this project isn't even in alpha yet
Everything is still in WIP so don't expect it to work yet.

## ℹ️ About
WF radio is an open source platform for your mods, modpacks and more. It means that instead of relying only on the big platforms out there, you can easily self-host and share all of your creations. It's meant to be lightweight, fast and simple.

## 🔨 Build

First make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **Node.js**
- **pnpm**

Then download all needed packages using
```sh
pnpm install
```

Finally you can run the backend using
```sh
pnpm start
```
Or alternatively
```
node server.js
```

## 🔧 Configuration

All settings are located in [config/config.json](config/config.json). For more explainations and possible values, give a look to the documentation (incomming).
