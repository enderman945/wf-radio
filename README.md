# WF radio

## âš  Warning: this project isn't even in alpha yet
Everything is still in WIP so don't expect it to work yet.

## About
WF radio is an open source platform for your mods, modpacks and more. It means that instead of relying only on the big platforms out there, you can easily self-host and share all of your creations. It's meant to be lightweight, fast and simple.

## Build
First download all needed packages using
```sh
pnpm install
```

Then you can run the backend using
```sh
node server.js
```

## Dependencies
WF radio is built using express.js for the backend and supports MySQL and SQLite databases. It still don't know what framework I'll be using for the frontend part. You'll only need node.js and a package manager to get started.

- **Node.js**
- **pnpm**
